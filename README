bcnm - a better client network manager
--------------------------------------

 bcnm is currently a set of tools to control the client side of a
WiFi connection.

 Ultimately, it aims to become a network manager for client machines,
similar to NetworkManager, wicd or ConnMan.
 It works out-of-the-box on Linux and is easily portable to other
Unix systems.

 bcnm does not perform any low-level, hardware-controlling work itself.
It just implements a state machine and send commands to other processes
such as wpa_supplicant and a user-configured DHCP client.
